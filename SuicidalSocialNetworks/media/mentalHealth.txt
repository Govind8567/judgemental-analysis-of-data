Mental Health Awareness Month: I have schizoaffective bipolar type and I just graduated with my BA in English (Magna Cum Laude) at age 28 after dropping out of high school and having intermittently relapsed into psychosis for a duration of 8 hospitalizations. With loving support success is possible
Not to brag, but instead of laying in bed ALL day, I laid in bed for MOST of the day, then got up and took a shower. Next up, I conquer the world.
Thank you to the woman who rang me out at Target. You saved my life 😭❤️
PREACH
It’s been 2 months to the day since I last self harmed. I just want someone to be proud of me.
I made a suicide scale. Hoping it could help others.
To the man who saved my life and never knew
Anyone else procrastinate going to sleep because they don’t want the next day to come, but then also get anxious about how many hours they have left before they need to get up?
i’m 365 days clean from selfharm baby
I didnt kill myself!
Want an emotional support animal but can't have one? Get a stuffed animal.

There is an Arabic saying and it goes like this:
To the person who deleted their post few minutes ago.
My doctor asked “Do you even want to get better?” in response to me saying I’m not in therapy because I can’t afford it
My wife has passed suddenly
I survived a school shooting, but now I can’t do anything
Does anyone else have random thoughts pop in your head about something you did years ago and get a sudden wave of guilt and feel like shit for hours?
3 weeks clean. I've painted every time I had a major craving. I'm up to 95 canvases. So an average of 4.5 a day.
Does anyone else feel super motivated and ambitious late at night or around bedtime, and then waking up with absolutely none of those feelings?
Today I'm glad I didn't kill myself yesterday.
Me irl
I got out of bed today :)
My Dad shot himself today..
Anyone else feeling very behind everyone their age. Like they're accomplishing all these things and I'm just here.

People who welcome you back with open arms after ghosting them during a severe depressive episode are like gold
To anyone suicidal tonight, look up the Rappper NF. All he raps about is how to face mental health. He's saved my life many times.
I'm SO Proud Of Myself

Depression does NOT mean feeling sad. Depression is a medical term for functioning below necessary levels
I don't have a lot of people in my life right now, but i wanted to share this: I chose life this morning. I chose my raggedy, rundown broken life. I chose me. And I think I chose well.
TODAY I AM 5 YEARS SELF HARM FREE
1 YEAR TODAY WITH NO ATTEMPT SUICIDE AND A MAJOR EPISODE
I want to be hugged. I just want to be hugged.
You are not lazy, losing interest in a loved activity could be a warning sign
Just because you’re struggling doesn’t mean you’re failing. Big shout out to all in the community who made it through another day. You’re all amazing. You got this.
Does anyone else feel like they "can't handle" everyday life as well as everyone else?
Does anyone ever feel like secretly moving away changing your name and ghosting everyone you know?
I think that “13 reasons why” is a very bad way of “spreading awareness”
Anyone else stay up late to avoid tomorrow?
I know it sounds cliché, but it’s crazy how much a walk outside can clear your head and get you back to at least a neutral state, if not a positive one.
Cake saved my life
My boyfriend undressed me without asking. It’s not what you think though.
Please brush your teeth, even if it's hard
I brushed my teeth and washed my face properly for the first time in a while
Just had my cousin's memorial on Zoom, and it was atrocious.
The more I educate myself in psychology the more I believe that there isn’t such a thing as laziness
It's okay if all you did today was survive
Today marks 3 months safe from self-harm. ♥️

Anyone else get these short waves of getting all pumped up to do more stuff in life? But then 10 min later remember that basically life is pointless.
I made it 24 hours without cutting myself or drinking
“Depression is being colourblind and constantly told how colourful the world is.” - Atticus
Anyone else feel they have lost so much of their life to mental illness?
unpopular opinion - mental health should be talked about, not normalized.
Does your depression ever make you feel that you're not depressed enough to have depression?
Live, Laugh, and Love
Does anyone else get surprised when someone likes you as a person?
Yesterday, I did 4 college assignments. Today, I did 5.
After putting off my driver’s license for four years due to my depression... I passed my test today!!!!!! 🥳

My Rapist is finally going to prison!
I did it.
My cat saved my life today
I finally managed to clean up my room after I've been struggling with my life for the past few months. It got pretty bad and I somehow gained the energy to do it. I'm very proud of myself :)

If you text “Home” to 741741 when feeling sad, anxious, or are in emotional crisis, a crisis worker will text you back immediately and continue to text with you.
If you’re needing a sign, this is it. Please don’t give up. You are worth it.
I’ve had a shower everyday for a week!
I went outside for the first time in 2 years I just wanted someone to share my achievement with!
Hey, sorry for interrupting your scrolling. Just wanted to check in, are you okay?
Does anyone else feel inadequate when compared to others who are their same age?
Why is it that every time I have a little inconvenience in my life, my first thought is 'i should kill myself'?
I DIDNT HAVE A PANIC ATTACK TODAY!!
It really annoys me when people mock your mental illness in private. Then pretend to be an advocate in public.
I brushed my teeth two days in a row
I considered killing myself this weekend. I'm glad I didn't.
Dont forget to take your meds
I've gone a whole calendar month without any suicidal thoughts
i’ve been clean from self harm for one year!!
Adopted a cat during quarantine and it is unbelievable how our bond together has helped ease the pains of isolation.

It's been 100 days since I last self-harmed.
A comic for people worried about starting medication
6 months ago I posted on this subreddit begging for help with suicidal ideation and for help with writing a suicide note to my parents. Today I moved into my university flat and I am ten times better!
After 4 years, 7 months and now 3 days, I am anorexic free!
I showered every day this week
CW: Suicide. I almost took my life. Twice. Therapy saved me. But my therapist didn’t. Here’s what I mean.
Things that I didn't realize were anxiety
RIP Chadwick Boseman
Don’t overthink too much. You’re hurting yourself. Relax and rest.
I finally showered.
I don’t want to kill myself, but I wouldn’t be upset if I was run over by a bus. That’s the stage of depression I’m in.
Does anyone else just desperately want someone to talk too but also hate the thought of interacting with someone?
Maybe I’ll dress up as a deer for Halloween so someone can hit me with their car.
I had 3 meals for the first time in about 7 months
So my therapist messaged me on Grinder 🤪
Good job
Read this, please
Aspergers Syndrome in a nutshell:
My life
Suicide hotlines are useless for people struggling with mental illness
There should be a psychiatrist instead of a school councillors to talk to students about their mental health.
100 days self harm free today!
Does anyone else stay up at night just because they don't want to 'wake up' the next day?
Saw a scar on my Arm from a serious suicide side attempt years ago and counted some "firsts" I would have missed out on, made me smile.
I drank half a bottle of water, took a shower, and cleaned my room :)
Yesterday I became 7 years clean from Self Harm! I’m so proud
We need mental health education to become a staple in our societies
Today Marks 1 year since I've cut!! IM PROUD OF ME
Are you also tired of pretending to be happy for other people's sake bcs they can't handle your sadness and you might just burden them with whatever you're feeling?
People should get mental health checkups
I’m an agoraphobe who has hardly left the house in 3 years. This week, I’m going to the movies BY MYSELF! This will be a huge accomplishment if I can do it! Anyone else been there? Tips?
I asked for help instead of cutting myself
I showered today!
hey you
Well, this is appropriate here.
I did it! I got a job!
I wish family members would STOP saying "Everyone has anxiety, you need to learn to control it." They know I have two anxiety disorders. I tell them countless times to stop. This is why I am MOVING SEVERAL PROVINCES AWAY. They do not respect my boundaries. I can't wait until I move in December.
My psychologist told me to kill myself
Anyone else feel totally fine and fully functional for months, only to suddenly fall into a month long depressive/anxiety episode for no clear reason?
Hello everyone I'm glad to inform you that I'm becoming less depressed and I'll be happy again.
I made my therapist cry today
Bernie Sanders is the only Democrat fighting for universal mental health care
Do you ever feel too depressed to do anything fun but then you get even more depressed when you realize you're not doing anything fun?
As a rape survivor, I want to let you know that things will get better! Maybe not now, maybe not immediately but they eventually will! Don’t give up!
You won reddit
Tik Tok psychologists are the absolute worst
I got dressed and brushed my hair today!
YAY
Take care of your teeth...
I have a million reasons to die, but I have ONE reason to live. ONE friend who cares about me. AND I'M GOING TO FUCKING LIVE FOR HIM
If no one is proud of you, I am. and you should be too :)
I didn’t realize how long I’d gone without laughing until something made me genuinely laugh
Has anyone else ever suddenly gone from productive / high-achiever to completely frozen and unable to do anything?
To all those people who are lonely like me and have none to talk with: I love you
First time in 6 years that I am not depressed on my birthday
My therapist told me something today that helped me a bit
Is anyone else depressed about working for the rest of our lives
I Am Thoroughly Disgusted By The Portrayal of Mental Health in 13 Reasons Why Season 4, And Disturbed By the Amount of People Defending It.
I'm proud of all of you for being here today. For choosing life.
I regret having a baby :(
I (m22) got yelled for openly crying on the beach.
You're not everyone's cup of tea
Broke down during my night shift in the ER tonight
Its not much but after 15 years of self harming, it has been one year to the day since I last had an incident. Longest Ive ever gone.
Did anyone else always get called mature when they were young, and then develop anxiety or add or depression or ocd?
This checklist has helped me through some tough times, so I thought I'd pass it on.
instead of being put into a mental health ward and restrained for being suicidal, people who are at risk of suicide should be allowed to go to a place where they can eat free ice cream while talking to social workers
Whatever happens, don't let "theepicking777" bully you into misery
Me with work.
I’m two weeks free from self harm!
I haven’t touched a cigarette in 2 weeks
Imagine the privilege that comes with being mentally stable
Does anyone else have this running "I hate myself" voice in their head that spontaneously replays over and over?
Does anybody else with depression struggle with bad emotional lows right after a really good event with someone you really care about comes to an end?
LPT: If you know someone who startles easily, don't laugh at them when they jump, and DO NOT start startling them on purpose. It could be a trauma response.
I’m not sure where to put this, but I wanted to say something because I’m proud of myself.
Does anybody else feel like they don't belong anywhere?
True
I feel bad for my cat because we don’t have a routine anymore.
Ever stay asleep because dreams are more attractive than reality?
I know most people won’t care but...
I'm sorry to those who had to say 'I'm just tired' when someone asked if you're okay.
im 2 days clean from self harm !
Some random guy saved my life today and he didn’t even realize it
I love you
Emotion Color Wheel. My therapist gave me this as a visual aid; it helps me to figure out what I'm feeling in the midst of panic attacks. I hope it helps you as well.
731 days self-harm free
Today is my birthday and I feel so lonely.
My little sister slid a note under my door telling me she loved me.
2 nights ago I lost my best friend, my father, to his mental health issues. I just pray he is finally at peace. Please always reach out to your loved ones who struggle with depression and remind them that they are never alone. Love you forever daddy.
After several years of therapy I no longer hate myself. I now hate everyone else though 🤨
I love you.
i completely shut down and suddenly "ghost" other people when i get hit by depressive episodes
I GOT 9 HOURS OF SLEEP LAST NIGHT
I finally shaved my beard after a year! And I sent 9 job applications in a roll! This all happened in one day!
Just because some people don't make a scene of their mental disorders, doesn't mean they aren't struggling
This sub is toxic…
I told my whole family I was raped by my dad my whole life...
People who are battling mental ilness on their own because mental health is still taboo in your country or because you don't have the money to afford treatment, raise your hand!✋
I learned an important lesson from my therapist about healing.
I made a big breakfast after months of not washing, barely eating, just not taking care of myself. It’s been ages. I’m proud. :D
Is depression actually just a heightened awareness of the pointlessness of life?
I’m a cancer patient. I’m done with chemo. My recent lumpectomy went amazing. My surgeon considers me cancer-free. My hair is growing back and I don’t hate it. I’m about halfway through radiation. I got the COVID vaccine. I’m working again. I start college in the fall. But why am I still so sad?
Anyone else think Instagram is so toxic for mental health?
I [14F] Survived A School Shooting and Now I Feel Numb
You don't need to have a crazy story to be valid
Would someone take the time to wish me a happy birthday? I don't have anyone and don't want to feel so alone today.
Does anyone else get a high from being with friends or family, and then afterwards crash into depression?
You can sound confident & have anxiety. You can look healthy but feel like shit. You can look happy & be miserable inside. You can be good looking & feel ugly. So be kind, because every person is fighting a battle you know nothing about
Does anyone grieve the potential they had but lost to mental illness?
We need to stop calling suicide an “impulsive decision”
150 Days today without self harming!
I recently read this and I think it might help someone else too: “Always do your best” doesn’t mean “work until you collapse”. If you push yourself past your best abilities you will do worse. Doing your best means knowing your limits and working within them.
No one ever talks about how tiring it is to have mental illness.
I don't want quarantine to end
My reason for getting out of bed every morning...
Happy birthday little brother.
61 days self harm free, and fifteen days off lexapro. It does get better people :)
Help me raise awareness for Men’s Mental Health!
I JUST FUCKING DID MY PROJECT IN FRONT OF THE ENTIRE CLASS WITHOUT ANY FEAR FOR ONCE OH MY GOD

Stop telling those with mental health problems what they're doing wrong without telling them what the right action is.
21 yr old M here just to say that yes boys can have eating disorders too
Does anyone else feel like they're simply existing & not living?
I used to desire sex and kisses, but at this point, all I want is to be comforted when I'm sad.
It’s nights like tonight.. I wanted to cut so bad and instead I just wrote I love myself.
I ate in a restaurant by myself!
I love you
I folded my laundry!

I work every single night, until 6 in the morning. If you are reading this, and are at risk, please message me. I will be awake, and will be here to talk to you.
4 years clean of self harm
Stop blaming your shit parenting on my phone.
I'm so happy I didn't commit suicide last May.
I JUST STARTED DATING MY CRUSH
I don't know if this is the right place to post this, but I just want to tell SOMEONE
Did anyone elses parents mistake depression for maturity as a child?
do you ever get into a bad headspace and then suddenly can’t quite imagine any times in the past when you were happy?
I just got my first paycheck at my first job ever.
He took a snack from me!!
Stop telling boys that they shouldn't cry.

Sending out hugs for anyone who needs one
We should make mental health checkups a thing
I finally brushed my teeth!!
Just because it is (sadly) normal for ppl to experience suicidal thoughts especially at the moment, suicidal thoughts themselves are not normal PLZ STOP NORMALIZING SUICIDAL THOUGHTS
It’s been 18 months since I’ve self harmed!
Saw this whilst taking a comfort stop
Revived a Baby, Feel Really Raw
I planned to kill myself today but I didn’t.
Does anyone else just feel like crying whenever you hear stories of people getting mental health support from their parents because you just know you won’t ever have the same?
it's okay if today didn't go as planned
Cleaned my room, worked out and took a cold shower. We're getting there 💪😊 Mental health improving 💕💖
does anyone feel more sane / less mentally ill when they’re obsessed with a tv show or something?
Has anyone been told they were overly passive but when you finally spoke out/stood up for yourself were told (in one way or another) that you were "crazy," "out of control," and should "get help"?
Took a shower yesterday after 2 months.
I failed my 2nd year of uni and I just need someone to tell me it's okay
If your behaviour has ever been called 'attention seeking'... remember these words.
Does anyone else with depression (or really any illness or just in general) not even have the motivation to watch shows?
my abuser is blowing up on tiktok
2 months self harm free!
I asked Dan Harmon for advice on dealing with depression, and he was kind enough to deliver
A seagull ate my hotdog, and I realised how much I want to be alive.

COVID-19 Is a bitch. If anyone during this time is having a hard time coping, anxious, suicidal, just bored or depressed. Please vent to me and I will do my best to help you and your feelings/thoughts!
I hate when people say suicide is selfish
Anyone else’s anxiety going crazy with all that’s going on in the world?
i just cried because i couldn't put an ikea bed together
This sub is depressing as fuck. I get it's a mental health sub but every post that pops up in my feed is "I'm going to kill mysef"
a woman waved at me and smiled at walmart and it made me happy :)
I finally quit
6 months self-harm free!
If approximately half of the population will experience a mental illness in their lifetime, doesn’t that mean there’s something messed up about the world we live in?
Can you be a "highly functioning" chronically depressed person?
For anyone else alone on Christmas, remember it’s just another day, and it will pass.
To the barista at Starbucks-
Calling Suicide Selfish
Mental health problems are not beautiful or trendy and I am so done with the media glamorizing it.
I hate how most suicide prevention messages focus on family
It’s been 10 years since my suicide attempt and I’m so glad I didn’t succeed!!
I’m 1,000 days clean from self harm today
I Got Out of Bed and Ate Today
I could really use a hug right now
I haven’t cut all year!
Don't even pretend to be happy anymore and people are noticing
people that don’t have anxiety don’t truly understand
I just had my very first business related phone call today (for graphic design) and I’m so proud of myself! Talking on the phone is always hard for me and I did it!! 😌😌😌😌😌
I ate my first full meal in months
Does anyone else hate the "If I can do it, you can do it" mentality
I’ve fucking done it.
Does anyone else get a weird feeling when thinking about how you are who you are and this is ‘your’ life, ‘your’ etc... Kind of like realizing that you exist?
I know Im a stranger but if anyone out there is feeling alone, depressed, scared, etc. And just needs a human to connect with, youre welcome to message me. We’re all in this together.
watched the joker last night
I feel like my “trauma” isn’t valid because it’s not as bad as a lot of other people’s.
My depression is really kicking my arse, partly because we're in another Covid19 Lockdown. The only thing giving me any comfort is my cat (I'm single and live alone). Anyone else living for their pets right now?
Pretty Ugly
I’m watching my sister die and I don’t know how to help her
I watch my online lecture and ate 3 meals today 😁
I managed to shower for the first time in 3 days today.
I wish there were mental illness recovery homes where individuals with the same diagnosis can live and recover together.
I finally have a friend.
How I became a happier and kinder person, and accidently started liking myself a lot more
Has anyone else lost "friends" that made it seem like your mental illness was a bigger inconvenience for them than it was for you?
Repeat After Me
F*** COVID-19! [NSFW Language]
My suicidal thoughts and depression.
Movies make personality disorders look quirky and fun. But I'm miserable not knowing who I'm going to be tomorrow.
Sometimes I just want to drive off of the road and wreck my car so people will come to my bedside and tell me they're happy im alive.
“How’s is your everyday?”
Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson shares about dealing with depression: "Make sure you're talking to good people about it. No shame in getting help and wanting to be better."
My mom just committed suicide
Does anyone else just have that feeling that they want to go home, when they’re already home?
Recovering from depression really feels like I’m trying to stay “sober”
Just spent 15 minutes being berated by a doctor for being on antidepressants, because "they're not good for your brain"
If you are suffering from depression or suicidal thoughts, this the wisdom I’ve gathered since my suicide attempt a decade ago.
Please stop posting your plans to kill yourself, it literally says in the description of this community to do it in r/suicidewatch
Did your parent ever say “stop crying before i give you something to cry about”?
I like to think, whenever you "pour one out" for a friend or family member who has passed, in whatever afterlife you picture them in, a cup appears in front of them and they get to drink whatever you poured out for them.
New job! Still homeless but I got a new job! Mental health is on the uptick!
I dont want to kill myself but I don't want to be alive either. It feels like I'm being forced to suffer and the only things that make me happy are just distractions from getting better.
I did it
I hate how people are expected to wait weeks, possibly MONTHS for mental health appointments.
I showered today.
I just had sex for the first time since I was raped
To everyone who's birthday was ignored this year:
I found a suicide note my bf wrote last night and I don’t know what to do
Is anyone else starting to feel like life is way to expensive to even try to exist?
Managed to get out of bed, get dressed, brush my teeth, have a coffee and take my meds. F you depression
Tired of playing scenarios in my head that don’t even exist.
Mental health resources are a whole lot of bullshit. Deciding to reach out for help is supposed to be the hard part. Not getting it.
Sometimes we need to laugh at our struggles. I hope you all are feeling well today.
They all want to romanticise mental health issues until they have to deal with the problems that come with it.
Watching all your friends moving on and doing stuff with there life while you're frozen in time and have no motivation to do anything at all>>>>>
I think my life is finally looking up. Im excited for tomorrow for the first time in forever.
57 days sober!
I got connected to the same suicide hotline operator twice
Does anyone else have difficulty holding down jobs because of your illness?
I called a suicide hotline recently and was dismissed because I’m a man and I have Tourette’s. 💦🦄😖
As i slowly understand my current mental state ive also realized that explaining or asking for help to the wrong people can be extremely dangerous.
To those whose mothers' love wasn't unconditional
Anyone else hate telling anyone how you feel because you feel like a burden
If anybody wants to play some video games and vent. I can play/talk with you.
I hate being told to "relax" while having a panic attack
I got an apology from my old psychiatrist
Why isn’t there a such thing as an urgent care designed specifically for mental health emergencies?
The life you are living is for you. Do it for yourself. It isn’t for anybody else. Live for you, honour you & love you. Never lose eye on that
How do I stop creating fake scenarios in my head that upset me?
Does anyone else get heavy criticism while have anxiety attacks? "You're overreacting" "fine, just have it your way then if you're going to make it such a problem" " you're ruining this by blowing it out of proportion" "you're not thinking right, so I'll make decisions for you" or is it just me?
Dear whoever...
I made a website for men's mental health.
I went to a protest and rocked this sign!
I want bad things to happen to me just so I can get out of doing things and take a break.
Instead of saying "I'm damaged, I'm broken," say "I'm healing, I'm recovering myself, I'm starting over."
I cleaned my “depression room”
All trauma is trauma!
If you’re reading this, just know that I fucking love you for making it so far this year. I’m so goddamn proud of you for persisting, don’t you ever think for a second your effort went unnoticed.
2nd day without self harm
Shocked
Does anyone else want to get better, mentally and physically but just doesn’t have the motivation to do so. Like you know you can improve but you don’t know if you really want to
Virtual hugs to all of you :)
Whoever comes across this, you're doing fine. Just remember that there's a whole community of people who understand and we're here.
My mental health is the equivalent of a dodgy knee. I'm not going to win any marathons but that doesn't mean i can't do one (and finish it in my own time)
First post. I’ve struggled with depression for over 12 years and I rarely put actual emotion, and pain into my art. Last week I completed my first attempt at expressing how I feel waking up lately, struggling with my depression and suicidal thoughts. Here it is: “The Hand I Was Dealt”
Does anyone else feel like they are fundamentally broken and never had a chance at being happy?
The power of walking
I've been struggling with my mental health for years and I've finally been brave enough to make an appointment with a doctor.
Tonight we sat and cried together. I forgot I had the power to help people even when I’m sad. Words aren’t always necessary.
6 months clean from self harm!
Maybe the last time I hugged my son.
It’s been 69 days since I last self-harmed.
Last month I attempted suicide for the 4th time. Today I was promoted a week into my new job. It does get better.
For the first time in my life, I talked with a professional about this and was told that I was downright abused and it's like a weight has been lifted off - It wasn't my fault. I wasn't a troubled kid.
Does anyone else get uncomfortable when people do nice things for you because you hate yourself?
True
I don't wanna die, just don't want to keep living.
It's okay to be a male with mental health problems.
I finally got the balls to sign myself up for a therapist!
In my opinion, I think schools, family, or people in general should start teaching kids about mental health at a much younger age
I'm sick of therapists using CBT where it isn't helpful
Leave a dot (.) If you need some nice words!
To all those suffering today: Have a safe and calm Xmas.
Psychiatrist told me that only girls cut themselves
My husband went into psychosis. I’m not ok
Self harm free for 10 years!
Finally cleaned my room and did laundry after 3 weeks
Isn’t this the truth!
If you have the power to make someone smile, do it. The world needs more of that.
The popular saying to “follow your heart/instincts/inner voice” is only helpful for those who have a proven track record of a healthy internal thought process. At 35 I’m learning that for me this is bad advice and I found that helpful to me to understand i interpret the world differently than most.
My friend died by suicide. Please listen to her wisdom & help me honor her.
Even if it doesn't go away, you can get better at dealing with it
Did any of you ever feel guilty about not doing any (school) work but felt so tired of it you couldn’t even think about getting started?
Abuse [trigger warning]
We had a protest in NYC called "I'M MENTALLY ILL, AND I DON'T KILL."
This is a battle I’m going to fight until the end. If I die, I’m going to die on my feet. My memory and appetite might be quickly declining, (as evidenced by neuropsychological tests). But I’m not going to die quietly.
Is it rude to tell people my dad died by suicide?
I feel really unwell because how badly my country is being destroyed by russia

Can we please let men open up without derailing?
Does anyone else feel like they just don't have an identity since you spend so much time coping with your illness?
Guilting people out of suicide by telling us to think of our families isn’t the answer!
Today I Got Up
I DID ALL MY HYGIENE STUFF TODAY
Self Care
the other day i got a calendar notification on my phone. it said "die"
Why are people like this allowed to be psychiatrists?
My depression is not an "aesthetic". It's not cute to be a "sad boy/sad girl".
Just a reminder: Reddit can be bad for your mental health, too.
Does anyone feel dramatic/like a giant burden after they start talking about their emotions?
I’m one month sober today.
I've been sober for 125 days now!
I wanna go home, but I’m already home.
Thinking about starting a subbreddit and or a Facebook group called "MENtality". A place where men can freely talk about their problems, to reach out to each other and help each other.
Everyone who's feeling down today, FEEL HUGGED. Let's wallow in our pain together (･ω･)つ⊂(･ω･)

My anorexia recovery
Everything is a fucking market
Ate without guilt for the first time!

It's okay to stay alive and stay healthy for the little things
I stop replying to people for no reason
Just want to give a shoutout to the person I love, who finally today, after 32 years, admitted that he needs to go to therapy
My boyfriend just killed himself
Do yoy guys feel like you don't deserve to be with your boyfriend/girlfriend because you feel like a messed up person and don't deserve happiness?
Anyone else just know they will eventually k*ll themselves.
Why people can't understand that sometimes there is no reason?
I Made FREE Mental Health Printables! (Planners, Self-Care Tips, etc.)
I tried so hard to love this country, but after all of the racism and indifference I’ve faced, I’m happy I can finally leave.
I brushed my hair
Best friend took her own life: the aftermath and everything else
You made it.
Online school is horrible
you ever push everyone you used to cherish out of your life because you overthink what that thing they said means when it really doesn't mean that and your anxiety creates false narratives of situations resulting in self destruction?
Does any one else get suspicious when life is going well and you’re happy?
I nearly killed myself today but I’m still here
i brushed my teeth
Does anybody ever feel numb for a long time and one day you get a slight rush of happiness and it makes you very emotional?
Does anyone feel like you want to hide and be alone for a few days after social interactions?
Treating someone terribly and telling them to go to therapy is kinda like punching someone in the face and telling them to see a doctor
I am not inspired by those that are perfect, but by those that are not perfect and do not pretend to be.
my friend just called me gross for struggling with hygiene
My first psychiatric appointment is today. Wish me luck!

Saw a pretty face in the mirror today!
I think mental health is a great subreddit because people come to places like these with humility and honesty. This is one place we are all the same.
“Maybe I should suicide myself?”
40 days hurt free. My urges are still strong, but I'm doing ok.

I want to hug everyone that's hurting right now and tell them that we all will make it through.
It's been a decade since I tried to kill myself
Is your mental health declining?
I was reffered to as low iq guy by mental health staff
I am one day free of abusive relationships
I keep thinking “I’d rather die than deal with anything stressful” but I don’t want to actually die.
I Dealt with a Dental Emergency All by Myself
Someone commented saying “I hope your next attempt is successful you fat fuck”
I’m almost 24 and feel like I’ve wasted my life overthinking, being anxious or depressed, having no direction in life, wanting to cut or commit suicide, being emotionally isolated from family, having no social life, feeling angry all the time, wasting money on a useless degree…
Depression is not just sadness
I called a helpline for the first time tonight
Does anyone ever get depressed because they feel average?
Just cause ur black dont mean u cant have mental illness
Just wanted to tell someone

Do others also have imaginary lives in their heads? Is it unhealthy?
I tried to commit suicide but my friends walked in the right time. Ready to make a change and open up
No Longer Having Suicidal Thoughts
People LOVE to love mental illnesses when it’s the broken sadness hopeless depression type but won’t hesitate to send us to jail or get us assassinated for a single slip of the angry uncontrollable emotions type
RIP 💔
Today I realised that the negative voices and the constant doubts going round in my head, the bad feelings ect ect aren't me, they're an illness invading my mental space.
Changing the way you speak helps to change your perspective.
Everyone cares so much about mental health until it comes to parts that aren't romanticized.
Is anyone else struggling to hang on right now?
If you were abused or felt unloved, unwanted, unheard or hated yourself as a child, please read this.
Who can relate?
Threw out a self harm tool.
sitting on my bed with my blanket over my head and body while playing animal crossing has become my new way of coping
Tell someone who is freaking out to "take a deep breath" instead of "calm down"
My experience in a psych ward
My depression is lifting. I haven't felt this happy in 3 years.
Does anyone else overly explain themselves about almost anything and or say sorry WAY TOO MUCH?
I'm struggling with something and I'm not even sure what to call it, so please help
cleaned my room for the first time in years
can a kid have mental health issues?
My dad told me I’m getting ‘fatter’. I didn’t finished eating. Weighed myself (no weight movement). Went to the toilet and forced vomit. I just don’t want to eat anymore. They know I’m bulimic for almost a decade. Work from home is affecting my mental health and hearing those words made it worse.
Give yourself the same love and affection you give to other people and watch yourself blossom to something special
Taking vitamin D pills cured my depression
I wish that therapy wasn’t so outrageously expensive in the US.
Was anyone else called a spoiled brat growing up (or anything close to that) but now realize it was a mixture of poor parenting and undiagnosed mental health issues?
Life gets a whole lot better when you stop waiting for other people to love you and start loving yourself
If you were given the chance of not have ever been born, would you say yes?
Did anyone feel worse after admitting you're not ok?
I feel bad that many posts in this group don't get many replies. lets try reply to two other posts for every post we put!
Today you have done enough by being
Going from extremely horny to feeling numb to being sad to feeling nervous and anxious to being on the verge of crying and having a mental breakdown to feeling sad and being unmotivated to feeling extremely angry is completely exhausting
showered, brushed teeth, ate breakfast
Stop over-emoting at funerals and stop burdening children with adult emotions.
Why does my (20m) mind immediately default to suicide when something bad happens to me?
Have anxiety -> go on meds -> no more anxiety -> go off meds -> have anxiety
A toddler said hi to me today and it made me feel human.
Is it normal to talk to yourself?
The cost for inpatient mental health treatment is fucking shameful.
i went to school on time today
Anyone here indifferent to being alive but not suicidal?
Animals know
I fucking hate being told how “strong” I am because of my trauma
People in their 20s: Ever feel like running out of time?
just found out someone whose mentally tortured me for years has been killed
I actually took care of myself today
I'm turning into a very hateful person and I hate it.
I think I was/am an unintentionally toxic person and its torturing me
How many people are we going to lose to suicide due to this quarantine?
I have been really happy lately
My dad saved my life and doesn’t know it
I feel like no one cares if you're depressed, but the moment you say you want to kill yourself, they care
Parents kept my mental illness a secret from me for 3 years. I had early onset childhood Schizophrenia at age 12. How do you think parents should go about breaking the news to a young child?
I finally told my mom
Say it with me! if 👏 happiness 👏were 👏 a 👏 choice 👏 everyone 👏 would 👏 be 👏 happy 👏
To everyone struggling to go to school or work this morning,
Andy Richter’s response to “Depression is a choice.” Nailed it.
To anyone who needs to see this: you are not your past trauma.
Has anyone else been excluded their entire life
I'm clean from self harm :)
I finally shaved!!!
Mental illnesses do not affect us in equal ways, but they all suck.

I don’t think people realise
You’re not a fucking manic pixie dream girl, and mania is not cute
I put blankets over my head when I'm sad and pretend I'm a turtle.
Does anyone else feel guilty for their struggles with mental health?
1 year clean!!
This mirror constantly made me feel like shit. Olanzapine and effexor has ruined my skin and I've put on a decent amount of weight. I hate what was looking back at me. So I did the only thing I can do well. Painted the mirror. I hate it less now.
Mental health has no direct “cure” and a lot of the times I think we have to figure it out on our own. Society doesn’t necessarily understand our struggle and we have to try and show them why mental health care is important.
I know it's weird to celebrate but yesterday was the most "normal" day I've had in 3 years
Just about sums it up
To the teenagers behind me at the store
HEY YOU, COME HERE
I built a free mental health app after being stuck in my tiny studio in NYC
is anyone super obsessed with how they walk?
I was 17 when the pandemic started. I’m now 20 but still feel 17.
ur telling me that people are out here living life with no mental illnesses? damn must be nice!
Small accomplished but Showered and brushed my teeth for the first time in a week
It's been a month since I decided not to kill myself.
Why do older generation people think depression is something we make up and it's just a western concept?
Let's love ourselves as well as each other. (x-post blackpeopletwitter)
Anyone slowly realize they were very talented at something just to have mental illness destroy everything?
Today, I managed.
I witnessed my girlfriend try to hang herself today, and saved her. I don’t really know how to process this.
Half years ago, I begged myself to live for one month longer, Tomorrow, I am going to my first job interview. Guys, no matter how hard it is, we could all recover to a better self.
I’m strapped to an oxygen machine and having a panic attack. I haven’t slept in 2 weeks; please does someone have a hug to spare and tell me it’s going to be ok; is anyone there
I got out of the house and went to a coffee shop to work today, after over a year of WFH
Found my cat
Deleted my Instagram account.
Self-care is not participating when you don’t want to.
I’m scared of getting better
I am finally out of depression!
I haven’t self harmed in over a month, I almost did today, but I stopped myself.
Held a child as he died
How do I(22F) get over the trauma that a kid(9F) put me through?
My son had a panic attack on Friday. We talked about it
Some psychologists say "it doesn't matter if parents tried their best, what matters is that the child never felt that it was enough".
“Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem”. Why does it disturb me when my mom says this?
If your compassion doesn't include yourself, it's incomplete - be as kind and understanding to yourself as you would be to a friend who is suffering
Has anyone else had depression and other mental illnesses for so much of your life that you feel like it's part of your identity and as much as you hate it you can't imagine yourself without it?
Six months after my suicide attempt, I’m traveling alone and loving life.
I went on a run today!
Well, I finally did it. I told my mom I want to start therapy.
What do you think life is like for people who don’t struggle with mental illness at all?
We need to change the way we talk about anxiety and depression.
Friendly reminder: just because you feel fine on your meds, doesn't mean you'll feel the same without them.
Can i have a virtual hug pls?
I was approved!!
I’m starting to understand why people love life. Just after 1 week of lexapro.
Does anyone else feel "addicted" to their depression...?
I unsubbed from every sub and YouTube channel I perceived as being based on negativity, including all political subs.
im jealous of all the people that dont suffer mental health issues and i hate the way they look down on me
I feel so unproductive and cannot motivate myself to be productive
I really hate hearing "It gets better"
Spending Christmas alone in bed with beer and joints, feels amazing not having the pressures of my shitty family around. Fuck them if they're not a positive part of your life.
Being lonely in the 21st Century where we are living in a super-connected world is fricking hard, mentally taxing and it burns me out
Birthday today!
Reaching an age I didn’t think I’d reach

I cry when people tell me I’m good enough
I deleted my social media
Does anybody else get that intense deep feeling of emptiness after watching some movies?
Keep going. You did not come this far, just to come this far
Why do people think I'd want to put in effort to fix my mental health?
WOOOOO
my brain tries to convince me that everyone secretly hates me
I want to live
How come no one talks about how hard it is to find a good therapist?
U.S. Suicide Rates Are the Highest They've Been Since World War II

Boy hung him self at school
Does anyone ever miss their old self?
I just want a test that tells me what’s wrong with me and how to fix it, is that too much to ask?
Mental illness isn’t a choice, we don’t wake up one day and say “Hey you know what?! I want to start hearing voices in my head. That sounds like a great idea! Let’s throw in some anxiety and a dash of depression while we’re at it!”
What do you stay alive for?
How much do you believe that people's financial difficulties can affect their mental health?
If Simone Biles can take a mental health day, so can you.
I actually can't stand the saying "Happiness is a choice".

Toxic relationships and friendships are worse for your mental health than you think they are at the time

Why does venting to friends feels selfish and manipulative? Is it wrong?
My ex saw my scars and she kissed them
After more than 2 years working on a relationship with a person suffering with mental illness, I can say I've reached a place where we both feel deeply happy and in love
I need a hug
I wish there was a magical pill to just not have life suck
One year ago I asked this subreddit “How do I find joy in life?”
One of my fish died last night :(
My mom told me I’m faking my anxiety and depression. “Nothings wrong with you, you’re lazy and use your depression as an excuse to not do shit.” And “what do you struggle with? You don’t have a life.”
I'm so in love.
I'm gonna lose my fucking mind over the elections [USA]
I fucking hate society and people
I tried to hang myself this morning.
Receiving help is not that easy. Why does society make it seem like when you reach out, you'll immediately get help?
Today I learned my support aid teacher in primary school told my parents “your daughter will never have a job, get a licence or get married” I was 10.

Driving around for hours listening to Nine Inch Nails and getting pulled over by the military police has been an oddly enlightening experience.
I am one month clean from self harm!
"Your child, your rules" is single-handedly the most stupid saying I have ever heard
Please
You wouldn't emotionally abuse another person so why would you emotionally abuse yourself?
I think people who make jokes/say that people need to “man up” or “grow a pair” or “be a man” are part of the problem.
Do y’all mentally ill isolated people sometimes just want someone to hug you and give you a compliment?
Achieved 1000 karma, even though it doesn't really mean anything, it made a rough day a little easier.

I am schizophrenic. I have the right to say no.
Religion used to mess with my mental health SO MUCH
I did something today that I haven't done since 2019
Building a game that's supposed to give depressed people coping tools
Why are cries for help always mistaken as attention seeking behavior?
It never ceases to amaze me how pets just KNOW when you are not okay.
